# Gaussian-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-Iris-data-set

-Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)

-In this Machine Learning Model , We used the Gaussian-Naive-Bayes-Classifier and the built-in iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.

-The purpose of this project was to create the train-test split function from scratch and not just that but to split the data into 3 parts:

1- Training Data

2- Testing Data

3- Validation Data



train set = 80%

            combine set = 20%
            
            /         \
            
           /           \
           
     test set(10%)     validate set(10%)
     
 
-First, We splitted the data into 2 parts Train_set(80%) and Combine_set(20%)
-Secondly, We worked on the combine set to divide it into Test_set(10%) and Valid_set(10%) 

-To be honest the accuracy isn't very high (sometimes it be more than 60%) but since we built the train_test_valid split function from scratch so this may happen.

-We also built the Accuracy function from scratch.

-You will the find also the Data plotted to help you understand more.
